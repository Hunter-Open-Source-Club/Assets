Hunter OSC Winter Bash {#winter-bash}
----------------------

First off, we wish you all the best this finals season.

We\'re planning a huge event to mark the end of the semester with our
very own Winter Bash on Friday, December 20th at Hunter West 415. Reach
us in \#general on the [Open Source Chat](bit.ly/HOSCchat) to get
involved. [RSVP before you attend.](https://forms.gle/tMREctFxiQioz9CT7)

1.  **Tech Intern Panel:** Got questions about how to land a tech
    internship? Don\'t know what to expect? Want to make the most of it?
    This is the place to be.
2.  **Tech Resume Worshop:** We\'ll demystify the tech resume, paying
    forward the feedback we got from interviewers. Be sure to bring a
    copy of your own resume.
3.  **Winter Project Kick-off:** Got an idea you want to pitch? Want to
    find a team to make it happen? Make a pull request on our [Github
    Planning Repo](https://github.com/Hunter-Open-Source-Club/Planning)
    or send us a message. Then we\'ll break off into groups and get our
    projects started.

Environment will be chill. Events are drop-in. Bring a laptop, a
charger, and start your winter coding off right.

Until next time, take care! \-- Prez
