Winter Bash
-----------

First off, we wish you all the best this finals season.

We\'re planning a huge event to mark the end of the semester. Reach us
in \#general on the [Open Source Chat](bit.ly/HOSCchat) to get involved.

1.  **Tech Intern Panel:** Got questions about how to land a tech
    internship? Don\'t know what to expect?
2.  **Tech Resume Worshop:** We\'ll demystify the tech resume, paying
    forward the feedback we got from interviewers. Don\'t forget to
    bring a copy of your own resume.
3.  **Winter Project Kick-off:** Got an idea you want to pitch? Want to
    find a team to make it happen? Make a pull request on our [Github
    Planning Repo](https://github.com/Hunter-Open-Source-Club/Planning)
    or send us a message.

Environment will be chill. Events are drop-in. Bring a laptop, a
charger, and start your winter coding off right.
